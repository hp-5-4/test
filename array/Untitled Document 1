**Introduction**

Hi everyone, and welcome to my presentation on the frontend part of a website using React JS.

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is declarative, efficient, and flexible. React lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "components". This makes it easy to create reusable code and keep your code clean and organized.

React is also very popular, and it is used by many large companies, such as Facebook, Google, and Airbnb.

**Frontend vs Backend**

Before we get into React, let's take a quick step back and talk about the difference between frontend and backend development.

The frontend is the part of a website that the user interacts with directly. It includes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that makes up the layout and behavior of the website.

The backend is the part of a website that handles things like storing data, processing requests, and sending responses. It is typically written in a programming language like Python, Java, or PHP.

React is a frontend development library, so it is used to build the user interface of a website.

**How React Works**

React works by using a virtual DOM. The virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the real DOM. When you update the state of a component, React updates the virtual DOM and then efficiently diffs the virtual DOM against the real DOM to determine which parts of the real DOM need to be updated.

This makes React very fast and efficient.

**Benefits of Using React**

There are many benefits to using React, including:

* **Declarative:** React is declarative, which means that you describe what you want the UI to look like, and React takes care of the rest. This makes React code easy to read and maintain.
* **Efficient:** React is very efficient, thanks to its use of the virtual DOM. This makes React apps fast and responsive.
* **Flexible:** React is very flexible, and it can be used to build a wide variety of user interfaces, from simple websites to complex web applications.
* **Popular:** React is very popular, and there is a large community of React developers. This means that there are many resources available to help you learn React and solve problems.

**Building a React App**

To build a React app, you will need to create a React component. A React component is a reusable piece of code that can be used to render a specific part of the UI.

Components are typically written in JavaScript, and they use HTML and CSS to define the layout and style of the UI.

Once you have created your components, you can use them to build your app by assembling them together in a hierarchy.

**Conclusion**

React is a powerful and popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is declarative, efficient, flexible, and popular.

If you are interested in learning more about React, there are many resources available online and in libraries.
